	<P>O benhê, te amo *-*</P>
	<P>From the unknownI ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
		Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
		Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
		Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
		I problem solve with Styrofoam
		My world revolves around a black hole
		The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
		Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
		I may go rogue
		Don't tempt me, big bullet holes
		Tote semi-autos
		Yeah, I'm keepin' it real, real, um
		Keepin' it real, uh yeah
		Life gets tough, shit is getting real
		I don't know how to feel
		Swallowing all these pills
		Know my real feels
		Devil standing here
		Tryna' make a deal, uh
		It ain't no deals
		Feel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here
		Losing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills
		I ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still
		Bein' me, I rock PnB
		These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ
		These drugs acting like
		Moshpits squishing me
		Oh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly
		Lonely, I been gettin' no peace
		OD, feel like overdosing
		Low key I been looking for the signs
		But all I can find is a sign of the times</P>
